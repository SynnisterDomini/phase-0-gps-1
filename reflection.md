What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was actually fairly comfortable with git; I feel like I may have gotten a decent amount of experience with git because throughout week 1 I was constantly switching between my desktop and my laptop, so git and GitHub were extremely useful for keeping my work consistent between the two computers.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

My guide clarified the difference between branch -v (verbose) and branch -a (all), in addition to the differences between fetch/merge and pull. In addition, I learned how to pull history text into a markdown file, and how to close pull requests.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I ran through this GPS with only my guide, unfortunately. I asked mainly about getting a subl command to work because I am using bash in windows, something that is evidently not normal for people to do. 

What still confuses you about git?

As of right now, not much confuses me about git, but I'm sure I will have questions when I start working with other people.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

This is actually my third experience pairing. I did the peer pairing sessions already, but they were relatively straightforward.
